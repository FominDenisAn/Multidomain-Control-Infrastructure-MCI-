# Multidomain Control Infrastructure (MCI)  

One Platform. Infinite Domains.


**Unify your infrastructure management today with MCI ‚Äî delivering enterprise control with consumer simplicity.**  

---

## **Project Overview**  
MCI is an **enterprise-grade platform** for centralized infrastructure management. It unifies control of multi-domain environments (Active Directory, cloud providers, Kubernetes) through a single, intuitive interface. MCI maintains robust security while managing:  
- Cloud providers (Yandex Cloud, Sber Cloud, AWS, Google Cloud).  
- On-premises systems (Kubernetes, Docker).  
- Hybrid architectures.  

**Core Value Proposition:**  
- Simplify complex infrastructure management.  
- Reduce operational overhead by **40%**.  
- Accelerate deployment cycles from **5+ hours to under 1 hour**.  
- Enforce security policies without compromising agility.
- And more.
